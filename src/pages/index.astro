			What ur looking at would have taken a day to figure out and setup locally for a first-timer even just a few years ago.  <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> is a framework I discovered before strategey and it is partially where the Ezoic Edge idea came from (serverless deployment, and no javascript runtime). This is a base boilerplate for Astro; which renders all the js in the cloud where content is cached. This means no origin or host. Satic pages served at 7kb or smaller right form the edge. The equivilant page in WordPress might be 500-600mb!!!

				Tyler made this message after his last Slack message to <you!>you! The template comes with a few integrations already configured in a
				<code>astro.config.mjs</code> file (u dont need to know that for now). You can see the files required for this to work over on the left.
				The src or public folders in a project usually refer to the folder containing the index((dot)).[insert framework name] here. Often it will just be index.html/php/etc.
			</p>
			<p>Here are a few ideas on how to get started with the template:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Edit this page in <code>src/pages/index.astro</code></li>
				<li>Edit the site header items in <code>src/components/Header.astro</code></li>
				<li>Add your name to the footer in <code>src/components/Footer.astro</code></li>
				<li>Check out the included blog posts in <code>src/pages/blog/</code></li>
				<li>Customize the blog post page layout in <code>src/layouts/BlogPost.astro</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Have fun! If you get stuck, remember to <a href="https://docs.astro.build/"
